"""
Your neighbor is a real estate agent and wants some help predicting house prices for regions across the US. 
It would be great if you could somehow create a model for it that would allow you to input some features of a house and return an estimate of 
how much the house would sell.
She asked if you could help her with her new data science skills. You say yes and decide that Linear Regression might be a good way to solve this problem.
Your neighbor then gives you some information about a bunch of homes in US regions. everything is contained in the file: USA_Housing.csv.
The data contains the following columns:

* 'Avg. Area Income': Average income of residents where the house is located.
* 'Avg. Area House Age': Average age of houses in the same city.
* 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Average number of rooms for houses in the same city.
* 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Average number of bedrooms for houses in the same city
* 'Area Population': The population of the city where the house is located.
* 'Price': Sale price of the house.
* 'Address': House address;
